# Lightshow
WiFi Lightshow service implemented on Arduino Nano 33 IoT

## Hardware
It's all sitting on a breadboard right now. I don't anticipate getting any fancier than transferring this to a [perfboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FFDFLZ3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00).

### [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-iot).
- 32-bit SAMD21 Cortex
- 3.3V
- 256K Flash
- 32K RAM
- 18x45mm

### [Adafruit NeoPixel Ring](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463)
- 16 RGB LED's
- 5V
- 16mm outer diameter

### [3.3V-5V level converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2C6SJJ)

- bi-directional

## REST Interface
I've found a decent article that's about my speed: [Understanding and Using REST APIs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)

That's about as far as I've gotten so far, but stay tuned.
